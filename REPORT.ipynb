The task involved adapting an example from the lecture material, running the model, and optimizing the implementation for time and resource efficiency. The trained model and the source code were submitted as per the task requirements.\n"

Given the constraints of this project, the focus was on experementing with the training process. This document outlines the changes made to the model, the challenges faced, and the results obtained.\n"

    " **Environment Recording:**\n",
    "   - Added `env = RecordEpisodeStatistics(env)` to try to monitor and log episode statistics.\n",
