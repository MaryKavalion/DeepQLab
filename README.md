# Reinforcement Learning for Atari Space Invaders

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train an agent to play the Atari 2600 game **Space Invaders**, originally released in 1980. 

The primary goal of this project was to adapt the Deep Q-Learning example from lectures to the Atari game **Space Invaders**.
