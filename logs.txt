1. I have changed the activation function ReLu to Leaky Relu
2. Added env = RecordEpisodeStatistics(env)
3. Running reward set to 9000

Visual Studio crashed after appr. 40 hours executing the script with last result: 
best score of last 100: 685.0, running reward: 198.80 at episode 615, frame count 340000

Tried to continue in Kaggle notebooks
Got ValueError: bad marshal data (unknown type code) when downloading the model, so decided to continue on the laptop

1. Running reward set to 1000 
2. Epsilon_max, epsilon changed to 0.7
3. Epsilon_min changed to 0.05
3. Max_memory_length decreased to 10000

After framecount 4930000 memory issues caused VS collapse.
1. Decided to go back to final_epsilon = 0.1, as listed in the paper.
2. Tried vectorizing the environment to speed up training. Got very strange statistical outputs for rewards and best scores which failed to fix before the end of the day.
 Continued with one-env training.
3. Starting epsilon set to 0.5 (as we continue the training process)

Final framecount was 5990000. This has been achieved after 3 sessions, each of which lasted for appr. 3 days.
