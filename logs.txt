1. I have changed the activation function ReLu to Leaky Relu
2. Added env = RecordEpisodeStatistics(env)
3. Running reward set to 9000

Visual Studio crashed after appr. 40 hours executing the script with last result: 
best score of last 100: 685.0, running reward: 198.80 at episode 615, frame count 340000

Tried to continue in Kaggle notebooks
Got ValueError: bad marshal data (unknown type code) when downloading the model, so decided to continue on the laptop

1. Running reward set to 1000 
2. Epsilon_max, epsilon changed to 0.7

After framecount 4930000 memory issues caused VS collapse.
